I was born in Caracas, Venezuela on August 11, 1997. I am a middle child with
a younger sister and older brother.
In 2003, my family immigrated to the suburbia of Raleigh, North Carolina, where we still reside.
</p>
<p>
I attended elementary school at <a href = https://www.wcpss.net/jeffreysgrovees>Jeffreys Grove</a>, which
is apparently a magnet school now. I then attended <a href = https://www.wcpss.net/leesvilleroadms>Leesville Road Middle School</a>
and <a href = https://www.wcpss.net/leesvilleroadhs>Leesville Road High School</a>. I played soccer throughout my youth, and though I was a mediocre player at best, I made many of my lifelong
best friends through soccer.
</p>
<p>
I graduated as the salutatorian of the LRHS Class of 2015 (as attested in
this <a href =https://www.themycenaean.org/2015/05/estellers-love-for-learning-pushes-him-to-do-well/>cheesy article</a>), and matriculated at
<a href = https://college.harvard.edu/>Harvard College</a> in slightly less subuurban Cambridge, Massachusetts. I initially studied Applied Math, but, after my sophomore
year of college, realized that Computer Science is my true academic passion. In another life, I served as the Editorial Chair of the <a href = https://www.thecrimson.com/section/opinion/>
Harvard Crimson Editorial Board</a>, which was difficult work, but is where I met many of my best friends in college, and my beloved girlfriend, <a href = https://www.instagram.com/allsyan/?hl=en>
Allison Yan</a>, who is a pre-medical student. I first lived in Eliot House, but transferred to Quincy House after my junior year, to be closer to the vibrant CS community and the aforementioned Allison.

<p>
To escape the confines of a computer terminal, I run, and occasionally drag my fat ass to the start line of a race. I'm a supporter of Liverpool F.C. and the Carolina Hurricanes. I enjoy
cubing, coffee, impressionist art, and reading (though mostly non-fiction).
</p>
<p>
After graduation (knock on wood), I plan to write the next chapter of my life in California, at Google, as a software engineer.
