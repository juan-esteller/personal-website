    In order to express my gratitude to the various resources that make this
    website possible and in the interest of (a slight abuse of) <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle>
    Kerchkoff's Principle</a>, below are the technical details of this website:
<ul>
    <li> I use the text editor <a href = https://www.vim.org/>Vim</a>, usually inside of <a href = https://github.com/tmux/tmux>tmux</a>.</li>

    <li> The source is hosted on <a href = https://github.com/juan-esteller/personal-website>GitHub</a>.
    <li> SSL server certificates for the comforting padlock in your browser are from the Certificate Authority <a href = https://letsencrypt.org/>letsencrypt</a>.</li>
